# Understanding SQL Joins

A **JOIN** in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of joins, each serving a unique purpose depending on how you want to retrieve data. Here's an explanation of the key types of joins:

## 1. INNER JOIN
An **INNER JOIN** returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables. If a record in one table does not have a corresponding record in the other table, it will not be included in the result set.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
This query returns employees who are assigned to a department.

---

## 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
A **LEFT JOIN** returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, the result will include `NULL` for columns from the right table.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
This query returns all employees, even if they are not assigned to a department. For those without a department, the department name will show as `NULL`.

---

## 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
A **RIGHT JOIN** is the opposite of a LEFT JOIN. It returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, `NULL` values will be returned for columns from the left table.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
This query returns all departments, even if they don't have any employees assigned. Employees not linked to a department will not be shown.

---

## 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
A **FULL OUTER JOIN** returns all the rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table. If there is no match, the result set will include `NULL` for the missing side.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
This query returns all employees and all departments. Rows with no match will have `NULL` in the corresponding columns.

---

## 5. CROSS JOIN
A **CROSS JOIN** returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning it combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table. Be cautious using this, as it can generate large result sets.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```
This query returns all possible combinations of employees and departments.

### Key Differences
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matched rows.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns rows when there is a match in either table.
- **CROSS JOIN**: Returns all combinations of rows between the tables.
